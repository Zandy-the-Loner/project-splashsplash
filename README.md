# What is Project Splash Splash?
PSS is an open source launcher that is mainly used for if you want to make a disclaimer pop up before another exe.

# Why are you making this?
Because I just felt like sharing code that anybody could replicate.
I felt like it would help for future projects as well, so there's that.

# How does it work?
It uses WinRar as a settler, that then launches the disclaimer, which then launches a setup/program hidden away in a temp folder made by WinRar.

# What is this coded in?
It's coded in Visual Basic 2010, that works using 2 forms. Code is provided above.

# Beta Testers?
-Amara

Idea: Toast's TSP2013 Installer, Those cool launchers.
