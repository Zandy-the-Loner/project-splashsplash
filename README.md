# What is Project Splash Splash?
PSS is an open source launcher that is mainly used for if you want to make a disclaimer pop up before another exe.

# Why are you making this?
I'm hoping to make a disclaimer when making project installers, with 2 layers of wrappers before the installer (spefically a winrar extractor, that opens the middleman splasher/launcher, before it opens the installer/thing

# How does it work?
NaN

# What are you gonna code this in?
I'm aiming for either C++/C#, or Visual Basic. If not, I'll try recycling code from TSP2013ModManager to make it myself, using the final screen, but this will be hard if I have to resort to it. If all else fails, I'll make a batch file and upload it here.

# Beta Testers?
Nothing here, check back later!
