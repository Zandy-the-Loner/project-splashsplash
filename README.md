# What is Project Splash Splash?
PSS is an open source launcher that is mainly used for if you want to make a disclaimer pop up before another exe.

# Why are you making this?
I made this to make a sample message before programs start, using WinRar self extractors as a base, that open the disclaimer, which open the thing.

# How does it work?
It uses WinRar as a settler, that then launches the disclaimer, which then launches a setup/program hidden away in a temp folder made by WinRar.

# What is this coded in?
It's coded in Visual Basic 2010, that works using 2 forms. Code is provided above.
