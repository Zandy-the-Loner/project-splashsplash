# What is Project Splash Splash?
PSS is an open source launcher that is mainly used for if you want to make a disclaimer pop up before another exe.

# Why are you making this?
It's to make disclaimers for seperate projects I'm working on, sorta to add a wrappaer to the installer.

# How does it work?
It's an exe that displays a fixed, unsizable window with a disclaimer. There's a button. Once this button is pressed, the splash "closes" and it launchers an exe, spefically a setup or game. It can be used as a launcher, or just as a splash screen.

# What are you gonna code this in?
I'm aiming for either C++/C#, or Visual Basic. If not, I'll try recycling code from TSP2013ModManager to make it myself, using the final screen, but this will be hard if I have to resort to it. If all else fails, I'll make a batch file and upload it here.

# Beta Testers?
Nothing here, check back later!
